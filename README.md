## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

It has been a while since I have done frontend mentor project. I feel like I coded this quicker than I would have in the past. I learned to make a triangle with css to put under the social section. I also made good use of flexbox to position all the elements. I also learned how to change the icon in the button to white using CSS.


### Continued development

I would like try using the anchor property in CSS to position the social section. I think it would be a good challenge and upgrade!
